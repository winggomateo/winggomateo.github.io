                    <p>December 2022</p>
                    <p><i>Book Cover Design</i></p>
                    <p><small><i>This was a project for <a href="#">Design Media Concepts</a>, a course taught by Amy Finkel</i></small></p>

                <div class="project-right">
                    <p>I redesigned the cover of On Writing Well by William Zinsser, a well-known guidebook on non-fiction writing. The original design was straightforward, but lacked visual interest, which is common for many guidebooks. For this redesign, I aimed to make the cover more visually engaging while maintaining a strong connection to the book’s content, which emphasizes the craft of writing. My goal was to create a cover proposal that would capture the essence of non-fiction writing—structured, yet creative—while appealing to a wide audience of writers looking to improve their skills.

            <!-- Section: Additional Text -->
            <div class="project-text">
                <p>In the first design, I wanted to convey the concept of writing and structure, so I used a series of rectangles to simulate the appearance of words in a paragraph. The title is intertwined into this pattern, ensuring it remains the focal point through contrast in size and shape. I chose a typewriter-style font to match the 1976 publication year and the historical role of typewriters in the writing process, tying the design to the book's era.</p>
               <!-- <br> -->
                <p>For the second design, I focused on Zinsser’s advice, which emphasizes the revisions a writer goes through before finalizing their work. I decided to incorporate a portion of the book’s text with pen marks to evoke the process of editing and refining. The title is placed over this with a white border to keep it readable against the busy background. Blue was chosen as the dominant color to evoke trust and reliability, creating a calm, professional tone for the cover.</p>
